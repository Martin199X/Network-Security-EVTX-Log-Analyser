# Description: This is a PySimpleGUI-based Python software tool for processing and visualising selected Windows Event
#              Security.evtx log files.
# Updates: * v3.0 (First Release).
#          * End-user authentication implemented in the form of a username and password. Useful for a security analyst.
#          * Some non app breaking text typos are corrected and verbiage edited for clarity.
#          * The PySimpleGUI generated windows are edited to have the same aesthetic brand identity.
#          * Create a user account upon authentication condition of password.
#          * Limitation from revision v2.4 corrected in line 89 and 125-126 to terminate script if the GUI is closed.
#          * Imported the sys module so that I can terminate the Python interpreter from running for security
#          circumvention purposes.
#          * Bug found by manually and meticulously going through script to discover that choosing to analyse data in.
#          lines 210-211. This was solved with a simple if-not statement improving usablity.
#          * Packaged this python script as an executable standalone .exe file so that the script isn't visible for
#          security circumvention purposes.
# Limitations:
#              * Testing With larger log files such as the Securityv2.evtx log file that I supplied it takes longer
#              to process, but, this is expected.
#              * The software tool does indeed notify the end-user, however, it would be a nice quality-of-life
#              firmware update if they were emailed or messaged the outcome which may be useful in an enterprise
#              when log files are much larger and could take a considerable amount of time to process.
#              * Created user accounts' username and password are not saved. Could be saved to a file to match
#              credentials from a dictionary so user does not need to create a new login account everytime they use
#              the tool.
# Installation: Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install evtx, matplotlib, PySimpleGUI
#               and lxml packages in a command-line interface. Depending on the operating system, use Terminal on a Mac
#               and Command Prompt (CMD) on Windows.
#               *pip install evtx
#               *pip install matplotlib
#               *pip install PySimpleGUI
#               *pip install lxml
