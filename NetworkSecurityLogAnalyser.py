# Description: This is a PySimpleGUI-based Python software tool for processing and visualising selected Windows Event
#              Security.EVTX log files.
# Updates: * v3.0 (First Release).
#          * End-user authentication implemented in the form of a username and password. Useful for a security analyst.
#          * Some non app breaking text typos are corrected and verbiage edited for clarity.
#          * The PySimpleGUI generated windows are edited to have the same aesthetic brand identity.
#          * Create a user account upon authentication condition of password.
#          * Limitation from revision v2.4 corrected in lines 90 and 126-127 to terminate script if the GUI is closed.
#          * Imported the sys module so that I can terminate the Python interpreter from running for security
#          circumvention purposes.
#          * Bug found by manually and meticulously going through script to discover that choosing to analyse data in.
#          lines 214-215. This was solved with a simple if-not statement improving usability.
#          * Packaged this python script as an executable standalone .exe file so that the script isn't visible for
#          security circumvention purposes.
# Limitations:
#              * Testing With larger log files such as the Securityv2.EVTX log file that I supplied it takes longer
#              to process, but, this is expected not so much a limitation but a side effect of processing large files.
#              * The software tool does indeed notify the end-user, however, it would be a nice quality-of-life
#              firmware update if they were emailed or messaged the outcome which may be useful in an enterprise
#              when log files are much larger and could take a considerable amount of time to process.
#              * Created user accounts' username and password are not saved. Could be saved to a file to match
#              credentials from a dictionary so user does not need to create a new login account everytime they use
#              the tool.
# Installation: Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install evtx, matplotlib, PySimpleGUI
#               and lxml packages in a command-line interface. Depending on the operating system, use Terminal on a Mac
#               and Command Prompt (CMD) on Windows.
#               *pip install evtx
#               *pip install matplotlib
#               *pip install PySimpleGUI
#               *pip install lxml
#               *pip install PyInstaller

# Import Modules---------------------------
from datetime import datetime as dt  # Working with dates and times. Refactored for more concise code
import re  # Working with regex
import sys  # Terminating the interpreter in python in line 91

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Creating various types of graphs and plots
import PySimpleGUI as sg  # Creating a gui for the app for increased usability
from evtx import PyEvtxParser  # Parsing and analysing EVTX log files
from lxml import etree  # Parsing data in events generated from xml content

# Main Body-------------------------------------------------
# PyInstaller Command = pyinstaller NetworkSecurityLogAnalyser.py -n Main --windowed --noconfirm --clean
# Command to package this Python script as an executable standalone .exe file for security circumvention purposes
username = ''  # Empty variable for username input field
password = ''  # Empty variable for password input field
# def save_login(username, password):
#    with open('login_list.txt', 'w') as f:  #  inputted usernames and passwords are stored in a plaintext file
#        file.write(f"{username}:{password}\n")  # write username and password to a list in a .txt plaintext file.
# Unused code that in my future work I will attempt to save login credentials to a plaintext file that will be hashed
# to provide improved confidentiality and integrity to the executable standalone application. To be hashed and salted.
# hashlib will be the module likely to be used due to examples seen of it performing well with PySimpleGUI.
# Will also need to import os for accessing files on a computer system to write list to project file location.
